## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for ARCHITECTURE

#### MONOREPO

- Configure workspace-aware tooling to optimize build and test processes
- Implement clear package boundaries with explicit dependencies between packages
- Use consistent versioning strategy across all packages (independent or lockstep)
- Configure CI/CD to build and test only affected packages for efficiency
- Implement shared configurations for linting, testing, and {{development_tooling}}
- Use code generators to maintain consistency across similar packages or modules
