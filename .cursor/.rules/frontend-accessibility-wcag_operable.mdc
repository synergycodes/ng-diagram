## FRONTEND

### Guidelines for ACCESSIBILITY

#### WCAG_OPERABLE

- Make all functionality accessible via keyboard with visible focus indicators for {{interactive_elements}}
- Avoid keyboard traps where focus cannot move away from a component via standard navigation
- Provide mechanisms to extend, adjust, or disable time limits if present in {{timed_interactions}}
- Avoid content that flashes more than three times per second to prevent seizure triggers
- Implement skip navigation links to bypass blocks of repeated content across pages
- Use descriptive page titles, headings, and link text that indicate purpose and destination
- Ensure focus order matches the visual and logical sequence of information presentation
- Support multiple ways to find content (search, site map, logical navigation hierarchy)
- Allow pointer gesture actions to be accomplished with a single pointer without path-based gestures
- Implement pointer cancellation to prevent unintended function activation, especially for {{critical_actions}}
