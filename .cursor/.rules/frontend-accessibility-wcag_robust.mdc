### Guidelines for ACCESSIBILITY

#### WCAG_ROBUST

- Use valid, well-formed markup that follows HTML specifications for {{document_structure}}
- Provide name, role, and value information for all user interface components
- Ensure custom controls and interactive elements maintain compatibility with assistive technologies
- Implement status messages that can be programmatically determined without receiving focus
- Use semantic HTML elements that correctly describe the content they contain (buttons, lists, headings, etc.)
- Validate code against technical specifications to minimize compatibility errors
- Test with multiple browsers and assistive technologies for cross-platform compatibility
- Avoid deprecated HTML elements and attributes that may not be supported in future technologies
