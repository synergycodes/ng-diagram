## FRONTEND

### Guidelines for ACCESSIBILITY

#### WCAG_PERCEIVABLE

- Provide text alternatives for non-text content including images, icons, and graphics with appropriate alt attributes
- Ensure pre-recorded audio-visual content has captions, audio descriptions, and transcripts for {{media_content}}
- Maintain minimum contrast ratios of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text and UI components
- Enable content to be presented in different ways without losing information or structure when zoomed or resized
- Avoid using color alone to convey information; pair with text, patterns, or icons for {{status_indicators}}
- Provide controls to pause, stop, or hide any moving, blinking, or auto-updating content
- Ensure text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality in {{responsive_layouts}}
- Use responsive design that adapts to different viewport sizes and zoom levels without horizontal scrolling
- Enable users to customize text spacing (line height, paragraph spacing, letter/word spacing) without breaking layouts
