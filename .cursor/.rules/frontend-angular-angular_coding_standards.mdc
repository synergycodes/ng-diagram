### Guidelines for ANGULAR

#### ANGULAR_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use standalone components, directives, and pipes instead of NgModules
- Implement signals for state management instead of traditional RxJS-based approaches
- Use the new inject function instead of constructor injection
- Implement control flow with @if, @for, and @switch instead of *ngIf, *ngFor, etc.
- Leverage functional guards and resolvers instead of class-based ones
- Use the new deferrable views for improved loading states
- Implement OnPush change detection strategy for improved performance
- Use TypeScript decorators with explicit visibility modifiers (public, private)
- Leverage Angular CLI for schematics and code generation
- Implement proper lazy loading with loadComponent and loadChildren
