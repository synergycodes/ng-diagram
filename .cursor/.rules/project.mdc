AngularFlow is a library for creating interactive diagrams in Angular

- Diagrams are DOM-based.
- Library complies with latest Angular standards.
- Project is organized into Monorepo managed by Turborepo.
- Core and CommandHandler are framework-agnostic, so in the future it will be possible to use them with other frameworks.
- Core and CommandHandler are environment-agnostic, so they don't rely on browser features.
- Core package should contain no external dependencies
- Write all unit tests in Vitest
