## FRONTEND

### Guidelines for ACCESSIBILITY

#### WCAG_UNDERSTANDABLE

- Specify the human language of the page and any language changes using lang attributes
- Ensure components with the same functionality have consistent identification and behavior across {{application_sections}}
- Provide clear labels, instructions, and error messages for user inputs and {{form_elements}}
- Implement error prevention for submissions with legal or financial consequences (confirmation, review, undo)
- Make navigation consistent across the site with predictable patterns for menus and interactive elements
- Ensure that receiving focus or changing settings does not automatically trigger unexpected context changes
- Design context-sensitive help for complex interactions including validated input formats
- Use clear language and define unusual terms, abbreviations, and jargon for {{domain_specific_content}}
- Provide visual and programmatic indication of current location within navigation systems
