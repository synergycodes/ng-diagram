# NgDiagram Docs

## How to work with Starlight

### Getting Started

Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm docs:dev` to start the development server.

If you wanna check out the preview (i.e. to see how search works), run `pnpm -F docs build` and `pnpm -F docs preview`

Make sure you know the tech you'll be working with:

- [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/) - the base of Starlight framework
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) - a markdown extension for JSX
- [@analogjs/astro-angular](https://analogjs.org/docs/packages/astro-angular/overview) - Angular integration for Astro

### Starlight Features

- [Markdown](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/) - about frontmatter and what you can do with it
- [Sidebars](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/sidebar/) - how sidebars are autogenerated from file structure
- [Components](https://starlight.astro.build/components/using-components/) - many UI goodies from Starlight for visually appealing articles
- [Plugins](https://starlight.astro.build/resources/plugins/) - extend Starlight with custom functionality

### Recommendations

- Use `.not-content` class to avoid default Starlight styles leaking into your content (i.e. NgDiagram components)
