description: Using ngDiagram on touch devices with native gesture support
---

ngDiagram supports touch devices out of the box, making it easy to build diagram applications for tablets, phones, and other touch-enabled screens.

## Gestures

ngDiagram recognizes the following touch gestures for navigation and interaction.

### Pinch to Zoom

Use two fingers to pinch in or out anywhere on the canvas to zoom the diagram. This works the same as zooming with a scroll wheel on desktop.

### Two-Finger Panning

Place two fingers on the canvas and move them together to pan the view. This allows you to navigate large diagrams without changing the zoom level.

### Long Press for Box Selection

Press and hold on the canvas, then drag to create a selection box. Any nodes within the box will be selected.

### Standard Touch Interactions

Many interactions work just like on desktop, using a single finger instead of a mouse:

- **Select a node** — Tap on a node to select it
- **Clear selection** — Tap on an empty area of the canvas to deselect all nodes
- **Drag nodes** — Touch and drag a node to move it on the canvas
- **Drag from palette** — Touch and drag items from the palette onto the canvas
- **Resize and rotate** — Touch and drag the resize or rotation handles on a selected node
- **Create connections** — Touch a port and drag to another port to create an edge

## Gesture Priorities

When gestures could overlap, ngDiagram uses the following priority order to determine which action takes effect:

1. Pinch zoom
2. Two-finger panning
3. Resize/rotate/link
4. Drag node
5. Box selection

This ensures that common viewport gestures (zoom and pan) always work, while node manipulation and selection remain accessible.

## Linking Mode

In addition to creating connections by dragging from port to port, you can trigger the linking mode programmatically using the [`startLinking`](/docs/api/services/ngdiagramservice/#startlinking) method — for example,
via a button in your UI. Once activated, the connection line follows the user's finger as they drag across the canvas. Lifting the
finger over a compatible port completes the connection. If the finger is released elsewhere on the canvas, the linking action is
cancelled without creating an edge.

## Actions Without Touch Gestures

The following common editing actions are best handled through on-screen buttons or menus in your application:

- Copy
- Paste
- Cut
- Delete
- Undo
- Redo
