Arrowheads in NgDiagram are visual markers that indicate the start or end of the edge.
They are implemented using SVG markers and can be applied to either the source end [`sourceArrowhead`](/docs/api/types/model/edge/#sourcearrowhead) or target end [`targetArrowhead`](/docs/api/types/model/edge/#targetarrowhead) of an edge.

## Default Arrowhead

NgDiagram provides a built-in arrowhead called `ng-diagram-arrow` that can be used out of the box.
This default arrowhead is an outlined arrow with rounded edges that adapts to the edge's stroke color.

<br />

<DefaultArrowhead />

To use the default arrowhead, specify it in your edge configuration:

<CodeSnippet relativePath="edges/arrowheads/default-arrowhead/diagram.component.ts" />

## Custom Arrowhead

You can create custom arrowheads by defining SVG markers with unique IDs.
Custom arrowheads allow you to create distinctive visual styles that match your application's design requirements.

<br />

<CustomArrowhead />

Custom arrowheads need to be defined as SVG `<marker>` elements within a `<defs>` section.
Each marker needs a unique ID that you'll reference in your edge configuration:

<CodeSnippet relativePath="edges/arrowheads/custom-arrowhead/custom-arrowheads.component.ts" />

When marker is defined in the SVG `<defs>` section, it can be referenced in your edge configuration to apply the custom arrowhead to the edge.

<CodeSnippet relativePath="edges/arrowheads/custom-arrowhead/diagram.component.ts" />

See [`<marker>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/marker) documentation on MDN for more details.

## Overriding arrowheads in Custom Edges

When implementing custom edges, you can override the default arrowhead with a custom one by specifying the [`sourceArrowhead`](/docs/api/components/ngdiagrambaseedgecomponent/#sourcearrowhead) and [`targetArrowhead`](/docs/api/components/ngdiagrambaseedgecomponent/#targetarrowhead) inputs of [`NgDiagramBaseEdgeComponent`](/docs/api/components/ngdiagrambaseedgecomponent).
Thanks to it you don't have to specify the arrowhead in the data of each edge.
