Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a diagram in ngDiagram.
They represent entities such as components, processes, or data sources within your system. Each node can contain metadata, inputs, outputs, or custom content, and can be styled or configured to fit your use case.

```typescript
interface Node<T = any> {
  id: string; // ID of the edge
  position: string; // The position of the node in the diagram.
  data: T; // Custom data associated with the node
  // ...optional properties
}
```

## Adding Nodes to a Diagram

To add nodes to your diagram, include them in the `nodes` array of your model:

<CodeSnippet relativePath="nodes/nodes/minimal/diagram.component.ts" />

## Default Node

NgDiagram provides a default node implementation that covers the most common scenarios. The default node:

- Is a fully styled component representing a visual entity with one input and one output
- Supports rotation and resizing (when enabled in the node definition)
- Displays a label (provided by convention in `data.label`)
- Responds to hover and selection states for better interactivity
- Is ideal for representing simple text-based entities

To use the default node template, leave the node’s `type` property **empty**.

### Features

The default node comes with built-in support for resizing and rotating through interactive adornments. These features can also be enabled in custom node templates.
To enable them explicitly, set the following properties on the node:

- `resizable: true` - allows the user to resize the node directly on the diagram.
- `rotatable: true` - allows the user to rotate the node on the diagram.

import RotatableResizableNode from '@components/angular/nodes/nodes/rotatable-resizable-node/rotatable-resizable-node.astro';

<RotatableResizableNode />

<CodeSnippet relativePath="nodes/nodes/rotatable-resizable-node/diagram.component.ts" />

### Ports

Every node can expose one or more **ports**, which define the connection points for edges. By convention, the default node includes a single input and a single output port, but you can customize the number, placement, and appearance of ports in your own node templates.

[Ports →](/docs/guides/nodes/ports)

### Customization

When the default appearance is too generic, you can easily customize it using CSS variables. This allows you to adjust colors, borders, and other visual properties without creating a new node type from scratch.

import DefaultNode from '@components/angular/nodes/nodes/default-node/default-node.astro';

<DefaultNode />

<CodeSnippet relativePath="nodes/nodes/default-node/diagram.component.ts" />

For deeper customization, you can also define your own node templates, giving you full control over the node's structure and behavior.

## Position

A node’s position can be set manually through the `position` property:

```typescript
{
  id: 'node-1',
  data: { label: 'My Node' },
  position: { x: 100, y: 100 }
}
```

The position is defined in **diagram coordinates**. If you want to learn more about how the coordinate system works, see the [Coordinate system](/docs/intro/coordinate-system)

The position also updates automatically when a user **moves the node** by dragging it in the diagram.

## Size

NgDiagram provides two main approaches to control node sizing:

- **Manual sizing** – explicitly set the node’s dimensions with the `size` property.
- **Automatic sizing** – let the node adjust to its content automatically.

The `size` property is **optional**. If not provided, the size will be calculated based on the content of the node.

To precisely control the size of a node, use the `size` property:

```typescript
{
  id: 'node-1',
  data: { label: 'My Node' },
  size: { width: 120, height: 60 },
  autoSize: false
}
```

:::note
By default, nodes use **automatic sizing** (`autoSize: true`). In this mode, the provided `size` property is ignored, and the node resizes itself to fit its content. The `size` property is then updated with the **measured values**.

To set a manual size for a node, you must explicitly set `autoSize: false`. Without this, the `size` property will be overridden by the automatic sizing behavior.
