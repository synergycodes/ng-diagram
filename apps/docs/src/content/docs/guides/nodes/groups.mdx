Groups in **ngDiagram** are containers for other nodes, allowing you to organize, move, and manage multiple nodes as a single unit.
They are essential for structuring complex diagrams, enabling collective operations and visual grouping.

## What is a Group?

A group is a node that can contain other nodes (children), serving as both a visual and logical container.
Groups support most node features but have unique behaviors for layout and interaction.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Container Node:** Groups encapsulate other nodes, but child nodes retain their global coordinates.
- **Visual Organization:** Useful for representing subsystems, clusters, or logical groupings.
- **Interactive:** Groups can be moved, resized, selected, and highlighted.

To add a node to a group, simply select the node and drag and drop it into the group.
To remove a node from a group, drag the node out of the group.

## Creating a Group

To create a group, add a node with `isGroup: true` to your diagram model.
Child nodes reference their parent group via the `groupId` property.

```typescript {3,11}
{
  id: 'group1',
  isGroup: true,
  position: { x: 300, y: 400 },
  data: { title: 'My Group' },
  // Optional: size, autoSize, resizable
},
{
  id: 'node1',
  position: { x: 350, y: 450 },
  groupId: 'group1',
  data: { label: 'Child Node' }
}
```

## Default Group

ngDiagram provides a default group template with built-in styling and resizing.
If you do not specify a custom type, the default group template is used.

**Features:**

- Styled container with content area
- Supports resizing and selection
- Highlighted when nodes are dragged over

## Resizing Groups

Groups can be resized interactively if `resizable: true` is set.
The resize adornment appears, allowing users to adjust the group's dimensions.

For more details, see the [Group Resizing via diagram config](/docs/guides/nodes/groups/#resizing-configuration).

[Diagram Configuration →](/docs/guides/nodes/resizing/#configuring-resizing-via-diagram-config)

### Resizing Configuration

You can control resizing behavior globally via the `resize` config in `NgDiagramConfig`, such as setting minimum group size.

The `grouping` configuration in `NgDiagramConfig` lets you control advanced grouping behavior:

- **canGroup callback:**
  Use the `canGroup` function to control which nodes can be grouped together.
  This callback receives the group node and the candidate child node, and should return `true` if grouping is allowed.

```typescript {3,6}
config = {
  resize: {
    getMinNodeSize: (node: Node) => (node.isGroup ? { width: 200, height: 120 } : { width: 80, height: 40 }),
  },
  grouping: {
    canGroup: (node: Node, group: Node) => true,
  },
};
```

## Highlighting Groups

Groups can be visually highlighted when nodes are dragged over them or programmatically via the `highlighted` property.

## Selecting Groups

Groups can be visually selected with built-in functionality.

[Selection →](/docs/guides/nodes/selection)

## Coordinate System

All group and child node positions are defined in the **global coordinate system**.
Adding a node to a group does **not** change its coordinates.
When a group moves, all its children move by the same delta, preserving their relative positions.

## Custom Groups

See [Custom Groups](/docs/guides/nodes/custom-groups) for information on creating your own group templates, registering them, and handling advanced behaviors.
