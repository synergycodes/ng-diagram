The **box selection** feature in ngDiagram allows users to select multiple nodes and edges on the canvas by drawing a rectangle around them.

## Usage

To activate box selection, hold down the `Shift` key and click and drag on the canvas. If two selected nodes are connected by an edge, the edge will also be included in the selection.

## Configuration

Box selection behavior can be configured via the [`boxSelection`](/docs/api/types/configuration/features/boxselectionconfig/) property.

<CodeSnippet relativePath="examples/box-selection/properties/diagram.component.ts" sectionId="config" />

Available options:

- [`partialInclusion`](/docs/api/types/configuration/features/boxselectionconfig/#partialinclusion): If set to `true`, nodes that are partially within the selection rectangle will be included in the selection.

  Default: `true`

- [`realtime`](/docs/api/types/configuration/features/boxselectionconfig/#realtime): If set to `true`, the selection rectangle will update the selection in real-time as the user drags the mouse. If `false` the selection will happen after releasing the mouse button.

  Default: `true`

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the box selection rectangle by using predefined CSS variables:

<CodeSnippet relativePath="examples/box-selection/styled/diagram.component.ts" sectionId="styling" />

## Touch Devices

On touch devices, box selection is triggered by a long press gesture instead of holding `Shift`. Press and hold on an empty area of the canvas, then drag to create a selection box.
