The **edge selection** feature in ngDiagram allows users to select edges on the diagram canvas.
Selected edges are visually highlighted, making it easier to identify and interact with connections between nodes.

## How Edge Selection Works

- Edges can be selected by clicking on them.
- The selected state is managed by ngDiagram and can be accessed via the edge's `selected` property.
- Selection styles can be applied automatically or customized.

## Default Selection

Default edge selection uses built-in styles and logic provided by ngDiagram.
The default edge template automatically highlights selected edges.

<DefaultEdgeSelection />

## Customizing Default Selection Styles

You can customize edge selection styles.

Here are a CSS variables you can use to style the selection highlight:

```
--ngd-default-edge-stroke   // Stroke color for default edge
--ngd-default-edge-stroke-hover // Stroke color for default edge on hover
--ngd-default-edge-stroke-selected   // Stroke color for selected default edge
```

You can override this variable in your styles to customize the appearance of selected nodes.

<CustomSelection />

<CodeSnippet relativePath="edges/edge-selection/custom/diagram.component.scss" sectionId="styles" />

## Custom Edge Selection

To use selection highlighting in a custom edge implementation, define your own edge template and apply styles in its stylesheet.
This allows you to control how selected custom edges are rendered.

:::note
Make sure to set `ViewEncapsulation.None` in your custom edge component.
Angular’s default style encapsulation restricts styles to the component’s template only.
By setting `ViewEncapsulation.None`, your styles (such as `.ng-diagram-edge__path.selected`) will be applied globally, ensuring that selection highlighting works correctly for custom edges.
:::

For example, you can set a custom stroke color for selected edges:

<CodeSnippet relativePath="edges/edge-selection/custom-edge/custom-edge.component.scss" />

This approach ensures that selection feedback is consistent with your custom edge design.

<CustomEdgeSelection />

<CodeSnippet relativePath="edges/edge-selection/custom-edge/custom-edge.component.ts" />
