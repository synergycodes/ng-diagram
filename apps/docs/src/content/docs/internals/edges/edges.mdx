Edges are the connections between nodes in ngDiagram. They represent relationships, data flow, or dependencies between different components in your diagram.

## Edge Properties

Edges have numerous parameters affecting their appearance and behavior.
Here are the required properties of an edge:

```typescript
interface Edge<T = any> {
  id: string; // ID of the edge
  source: string; // ID of the source node
  sourcePort: string; // ID of the port on the source node
  target: string; // ID of the target node
  targetPort: string; // ID of the port on the target node
  data: T; // Custom data associated with the edge
  // ...optional properties
}
```

## Adding Edges to a Diagram

To add edges to your diagram, include them in the `edges` array of your model:

## Default Edge

NgDiagram provides a default edge implementation that handles most common use cases. The default edge:

- Automatically calculates the path between connected nodes
- Supports three [built-in routing algorithms](/docs/internals/edges/routing)
- Can display arrowheads at either end

### Customization

NgDiagram's default edges offer several customization options:

- Custom arrowheads (defined as SVG markers)
- CSS variable based styling (stroke, hover / selection states etc.)
- [Built-in routing algorithms](/docs/internals/edges/routing)

import DefaultEdge from '@components/angular/edges/edges/default-edge/default-edge.astro';

<DefaultEdge />

<CodeSnippet relativePath="edges/edges/default-edge/diagram.component.ts" />

Use Custom Edges for even more control over edge look and functionality

## Ports

Ports are connection points on nodes where edges can start or end.
Each port has an ID unique within its node.
These IDs (along with their parent node IDs) are used to specify the exact position where edges should be attached.

## Routing

Edges can be routed using three [built-in routing algorithms](/docs/internals/edges/routing):

- `polyline`: Draws a polyline (straight line by default)
- `orthogonal`: Draws a series of horizontal and vertical lines
- `bezier`: Draws a bezier curve

import Routing from '@components/angular/edges/routing/routing.astro';

## Creating Edges Through User Interaction

When users create edges by dragging between ports, you can customize both the temporary edge shown during dragging and the final edge that gets created. This is done through the `linking` configuration in your diagram's config.

### Customizing Edge Creation

The `linking` configuration provides two builder functions:

- **`temporaryEdgeDataBuilder`** - Customizes the edge shown while dragging
- **`finalEdgeDataBuilder`** - Customizes the final edge when connection is completed

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'my-diagram',
  template: ` <ng-diagram [model]="model" [config]="config" /> `,
  providers: [provideNgDiagram()],
})
export class MyDiagramComponent {
  model = initializeModel({
    /* ... */
  });

  config: NgDiagramConfig = {
    linking: {
      temporaryEdgeDataBuilder: (defaultEdge) => ({
        ...defaultEdge,
        routing: 'bezier', // Use bezier routing for temporary edge
        type: 'preview', // Use a custom edge template
      }),
      finalEdgeDataBuilder: (defaultEdge) => ({
        ...defaultEdge,
        data: {
          ...defaultEdge.data,
          createdAt: new Date(),
          status: 'active',
        },
        type: 'custom',
        routing: 'orthogonal',
      }),
    },
  };
}
```

This allows you to:

- Set different edge types for preview vs final edges
- Add custom data to newly created edges
- Apply specific routing algorithms
- Control the visual appearance and behavior
