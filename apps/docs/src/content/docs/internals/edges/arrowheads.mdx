Arrowheads in NgDiagram are visual markers that indicate the start or end of the edge. They are implemented using SVG markers and can be applied to either the source end (`sourceArrowhead`) or target end (`targetArrowhead`) of an edge.

## Default Arrowhead

NgDiagram provides a built-in arrowhead called `ng-diagram-arrow` that can be used out of the box. This default arrowhead is a simple triangular arrow that adapts to the edge's stroke color.

<DefaultArrowhead />

To use the default arrowhead, specify it in your edge configuration:

<CodeSnippet
  relativePath="edges/arrowheads/default-arrowhead/diagram.component.ts"
  range={[53, 75]}
  collapse={['4-10', '15-21']}
  mark={[3, { range: '13-14' }]}
/>

## Custom Arrowhead

You can create custom arrowheads by defining SVG markers with unique IDs. Custom arrowheads allow you to create distinctive visual styles that match your application's design requirements.

<CustomArrowhead />

Custom arrowheads need to be defined as SVG `<marker>` elements within a `<defs>` section. Each marker needs a unique ID that you'll reference in your edge configuration:

<CodeSnippet
  relativePath="edges/arrowheads/custom-arrowhead/custom-arrowheads.component.ts"
  range={[3, 71]}
  mark={[{ range: '6-23' }, { range: '25-42' }, { range: '44-54' }]}
/>

When marker is defined in the SVG `<defs>` section, it can be referenced in your edge configuration to apply the custom arrowhead to the edge.

<CodeSnippet
  relativePath="edges/arrowheads/custom-arrowhead/diagram.component.ts"
  range={[32, 98]}
  collapse={['3-37', '41-46', '50-55', '59-64']}
  mark={[40, 49, 58]}
/>

See [`<marker>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/marker) documentation on MDN for more details.
