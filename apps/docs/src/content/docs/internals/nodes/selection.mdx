The **selection** feature in NgDiagram allows users to select nodes on the diagram area.
Selected nodes are visually highlighted, making it easier to identify and interact with them.

Selection can be enabled per node using a directive and is reflected in the node's appearance.

## How Selection Works

- Nodes can be selected by clicking on them.
- The selected state is managed by NgDiagram and can be accessed via the node's data.
- Selection can be enabled per node using a directive.

## Adding Selection to a Custom Node

To make a custom node selectable, add the `NgDiagramNodeSelectedDirective` as a host directive in your node component:

<CodeSnippet relativePath="nodes/selection/node.component.ts" mark={[{ range: '18-20' }]} collapse={['1-7', '21-38']} />

## Enabling Selection for a Node

Selection is enabled by default for nodes that use the `NgDiagramNodeSelectedDirective`.  
You do not need to set any additional property in the node data.

When a node is selected, it will be visually highlighted according to the styles defined in your application.

## Customizing Selection Styles

### Styling the Selection Shadow

Here is the CSS variable you can use to style the selection highlight:

```
--ngd-selected-node-box-shadow    // Box shadow for selected node
```

You can override this variable in your styles to customize the appearance of selected nodes.

## Example

<Selection />
