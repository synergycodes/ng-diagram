ngDiagram follows a layered architecture that separates concerns and enables extensibility. This design makes it easy to understand, customize, and extend for your specific needs.

## Architecture Flow

When a user interacts with the diagram, here's what happens:

1. **User Interaction**: User clicks, drags, or presses keys on diagram components
2. **Event Capture & Processing**: User interactions are captured and processed to determine the appropriate action
3. **Command Emission**: Based on the event, one or more commands are emitted to represent the intended operation
4. **Middleware Pipeline**: Commands flow through middleware chain for validation, transformation, or side effects
5. **Model Update**: Final state changes are applied to the model
6. **UI Reactivity**: Angular signals automatically update the UI to reflect new state

This unidirectional flow ensures predictable behavior and makes debugging straightforward.

## Architecture Layers

### Components Layer

The user-facing components that render the diagram and handle user interactions:

- [**ng-diagram**](/docs/api/components/ngdiagramcomponent): Main component that renders the entire diagram, handles user interactions, and orchestrates all functionality
- [**ng-diagram-background**](/docs/api/components/ngdiagrambackgroundcomponent): Background component that renders the diagram's background grid
- [**ng-diagram-resize-adornment**](/docs/api/components/ngdiagramnoderesizeadornmentcomponent) and [**ng-diagram-rotate-adornment**](/docs/api/components/ngdiagramnoderotateadornmentcomponent): Utility components that can be embedded in custom node templates to provide resize and rotation functionality
- [**ng-diagram-palette-item**](/docs/api/components/ngdiagrampaletteitemcomponent): Drag and drop component that can be placed anywhere in your application to create palette functionality
- [**ng-diagram-palette-item-preview**](/docs/api/components/ngdiagrampaletteitempreviewcomponent): Preview component that shows a visual representation of palette items during drag operations
- [**ng-diagram-base-edge**](/docs/api/components/ngdiagrambaseedgecomponent): Foundation component for building custom edge templates with advanced styling and behavior
- [**ng-diagram-base-edge-label**](/docs/api/components/ngdiagrambaseedgelabelcomponent): Base component for creating custom edge labels with consistent styling and positioning
- [**ng-diagram-port**](/docs/api/components/ngdiagramportcomponent): Port component that defines connection points on nodes for edge connections

### Service Layer

Specialized services provide different levels of control and functionality:

- [**NgDiagramService**](/docs/api/services/ngdiagramservice): Core service providing middleware management, routing management, and transaction handling
- [**NgDiagramModelService**](/docs/api/services/ngdiagrammodelservice): Handles model operations including node/edge updates, spatial queries, and data access
- [**NgDiagramViewportService**](/docs/api/services/ngdiagramviewportservice): Manages viewport state with reactive signals for position, scale, and coordinate transformations
- [**NgDiagramSelectionService**](/docs/api/services/ngdiagramselectionservice): Manages selection state with methods for selecting/deselecting nodes and edges
- [**NgDiagramNodeService**](/docs/api/services/ngdiagramnodeservice): Provides node-specific operations
- [**NgDiagramGroupsService**](/docs/api/services/ngdiagramgroupsservice): Manages group node operations such as member management
- [**NgDiagramClipboardService**](/docs/api/services/ngdiagramclipboardservice): Manages copy/paste operations for diagram elements

All services are provided through `provideNgDiagram()`, allowing multiple diagrams on the same page to maintain their own isolated state and behavior. Learn more in the [Services documentation](/docs/intro/services).

### Event Layer

The event layer captures user interactions and translates them into commands that modify the diagram state:

- **Event Capture**: User interactions (clicks, drags, keyboard input) are captured by the diagram components
- **Event Processing**: Each interaction type is processed to understand the user's intent and context (what was clicked, modifier keys, coordinates)
- **Command Emission**: Based on the processed event, appropriate commands are emitted to perform the desired operation

Supported interactions include: selection, panning, zooming, node movement, resizing, rotation, edge creation (linking), clipboard operations (copy/paste/cut), and palette item drops.

### Command System

Commands provide precise, structured instructions for state changes in the diagram. After events are processed, handlers emit commands that represent the intended operation:

- **Atomic Operations**: Each command represents a single, well-defined action (select, moveNode, addEdge, etc.)
- **Command Emission**: Event handlers analyze user interactions and emit appropriate commands through the CommandHandler
- **Transaction Support**: Commands can be grouped into [transactions](/docs/guides/transactions) for atomic execution, ensuring data consistency
- **Extensible**: The system supports 40+ built-in commands and can be extended with custom commands

The command system acts as the bridge between user interactions (events) and state changes (model updates), ensuring all modifications go through a controlled, predictable pipeline.

### Middleware System

Middleware intercepts commands before they reach the model, enabling behavior extension without modifying core code:

- **Plugin Architecture**: Add, remove, or modify behaviors without changing core code, making the system highly extensible
- **Processing Pipeline**: Middleware processes commands and state updates in sequence, allowing for validation, transformation, and side effects
- **Configurable**: Each middleware can be enabled/disabled and configured at runtime, providing flexibility
- **Async Support**: Middlewares can perform asynchronous operations like API calls or validations

Learn more in the [Middlewares documentation](/docs/guides/middlewares).

### Data Model

The foundation that stores diagram state and provides the data layer:

- **Nodes**: Visual elements with position, data, and behavior that represent entities in your diagram. See [Nodes documentation](/docs/guides/nodes/nodes) for details.
- **Edges**: Connections between nodes with routing and styling that represent relationships. See [Edges documentation](/docs/guides/edges/edges) for details.
- **Metadata**: Viewport state, middleware configurations, and other settings that control diagram behavior

The default Signal Model uses Angular signals for reactive state management, providing excellent performance and real-time updates. For advanced use cases, custom model adapters can integrate with external data sources like databases or APIs. Learn more in the [State Management documentation](/docs/guides/state-management).
