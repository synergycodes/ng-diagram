ngDiagram is a powerful diagramming library for Angular applications that enables you to create interactive flow diagrams, node-based editors, and visual programming interfaces.

## Understanding Diagram Elements

Before we dive into ngDiagram, let's first understand the fundamental elements that make up any diagram:

### Nodes

Nodes are the primary visual elements in your diagram. They represent entities, processes, or data points in your system.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Visual Representation**: Each node has a position, size, and visual appearance
- **Data Container**: Nodes can store custom data for your application logic
- **Interactive Behavior**: Nodes can be draggable, resizable, rotatable, and selectable
- **Grouping**: Nodes can be organized into groups for better visual organization
- **Templates**: Custom visual representations for different node types

### Ports

Ports are connection points on nodes where edges can start or end. They provide structured connection points and enable validation.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Connection Points**: Ports define where edges can connect on a node
- **Positioning**: Ports can be placed on any side of a node (left, right, top, bottom) in the center of the edge by default. They can also be precisely positioned using CSS properties (top, left, bottom, right)

### Edges

Edges connect nodes and represent relationships, data flow, or dependencies between elements.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Connection Points**: Edges connect from one node to another
- **Routing**: Edges can follow different paths (straight, curved, orthogonal)
- **Ports**: Edges can connect to specific connection points on nodes
- **Styling**: Custom visual appearance with colors, line styles, and arrows
- **Validation**: Connection rules can be enforced during edge creation

Now that you understand the basic elements, let's explore what ngDiagram offers.

## What is ngDiagram?

ngDiagram is a comprehensive diagramming library built specifically for Angular developers. It provides everything you need to create sophisticated, interactive diagrams in your web applications.

### What You Can Build

With ngDiagram, you can create:

- **Flow Diagrams**: Process flows, decision trees, and workflow visualizations
- **Node-Based Editors**: Visual programming interfaces and data flow editors
- **Network Diagrams**: System architectures and network topologies
- **Mind Maps**: Hierarchical information structures and brainstorming tools
- **Circuit Diagrams**: Electronic schematics and technical drawings
- **Custom Visualizations**: Any diagram type with custom node and edge templates

### Key Features

ngDiagram provides a complete toolkit for creating interactive diagrams with:

- **Interactive Elements**: Draggable, resizable, and rotatable nodes with smooth animations
- **Flexible Connections**: Customizable edges with various routing options (straight, curved, orthogonal)
- **Flexible Styling**: Built-in design system with CSS variables and themes for consistent styling across your diagrams. More details can be found in the [Styling](./styling) section
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin-based system for custom behaviors and business logic
- **Reactive State Management**: Built on Angular signals for optimal performance and real-time updates
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with generic templates for compile-time error checking
- **Modern Angular**: Built with the latest Angular patterns, signals, and best practices

## Core Architecture

ngDiagram follows a architecture that separates concerns and enables extensibility. This design makes it easy to understand, customize, and extend for your specific needs.

### 1. Components Layer

The user-facing components that render the diagram and handle user interactions:

- **ng-diagram**: Main component that renders the entire diagram, handles user interactions, and orchestrates all functionality
- **ng-diagram-resize/rotate**: Utility components that can be embedded in custom node templates to provide resize and rotation functionality
- **ng-diagram-palette-item**: Drag and drop component that can be placed anywhere in your application to create palette functionality
- **ng-diagram-base-edge**: Foundation component for building custom edge templates with advanced styling and behavior

### 2. Services Layer

Specialized services provide different levels of control and functionality:

- **NgDiagramService**: Provides advanced control and middleware management. It gives you access to the command system for programmatic control, middleware registration and configuration, transaction handling for atomic operations, and access to action state
- **NgDiagramModelService**: Handles model-specific operations and spatial queries. It provides methods for updating node and edge data, finding elements by ID, performing spatial queries to find nearby nodes and ports, and accessing the underlying model adapter
- **NgDiagramViewportService**: Manages viewport and scale operations. It provides reactive signals for the current viewport position and zoom scale, enabling components to reactively respond to viewport changes

All services are scoped within `ng-diagram-context`, enabling multiple diagrams on the same page with isolated state and behavior.

### 3. Command System

Commands provide precise instructions for what needs to be done in the diagram. This system ensures data consistency and enables powerful features:

- **Atomic Operations**: Each command represents a single, well-defined action that can be executed, undone, or redone
- **Transaction Support**: Commands can be grouped into transactions for atomic execution, ensuring data consistency
- **Extensible**: Custom commands can be added for specific use cases, enabling domain-specific operations

### 4. Middleware System

Middleware intercepts between the engine and state, enabling behavior extension without modifying core code:

- **Plugin Architecture**: Add, remove, or modify behaviors without changing core code, making the system highly extensible
- **Processing Pipeline**: Middleware processes data transformations in sequence, allowing for complex business logic
- **Configurable**: Each middleware can be enabled/disabled and configured at runtime, providing flexibility

### 5. Data Model

The foundation that stores diagram state and provides the data layer:

- **Nodes**: Visual elements with position, data, and behavior that represent entities in your diagram
- **Edges**: Connections between nodes with routing and styling that represent relationships
- **Metadata**: Viewport state, middleware configurations, and other settings that control diagram behavior

The default Signal Model uses Angular signals for reactive state management, providing excellent performance and real-time updates. For advanced use cases, custom model adapters can integrate with external data sources like databases or APIs.
