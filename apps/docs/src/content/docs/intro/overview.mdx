## What is ngDiagram?

ngDiagram is a powerful diagramming library for Angular applications that enables you to create interactive diagrams, node-based editors, and visual programming interfaces.

### What You Can Build

With ngDiagram, you can create:

- **Flow Diagrams**: Process flows, decision trees, and workflow visualizations
- **Node-Based Editors**: Visual programming interfaces and data flow editors
- **Network Diagrams**: System architectures and network topologies
- **Mind Maps**: Hierarchical information structures and brainstorming tools
- **Circuit Diagrams**: Electronic schematics and technical drawings
- **Custom Visualizations**: Any diagram type with custom node and edge templates

### Key Features

ngDiagram provides a complete toolkit for creating interactive diagrams with:

- **Interactive Elements**: Draggable, resizable, and rotatable nodes with smooth animations
- **Flexible Connections**: Customizable edges with various routing options (straight, curved, orthogonal)
- **Flexible Styling**: Built-in design system with CSS variables and themes for consistent styling across your diagrams. More details can be found in the [Styling](../styling) section
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin-based system for custom behaviors and business logic
- **Reactive State Management**: Built on Angular signals for optimal performance and real-time updates
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with generic templates for compile-time error checking

## Understanding Diagram Elements

Before diving into the technical architecture, let's understand the fundamental elements that make up any diagram:

### Nodes

Nodes are the primary visual elements in your diagram. They represent entities, processes, or data points in your system.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Visual Representation**: Each node has a position, size, and visual appearance
- **Data Container**: Nodes can store custom data for your application logic
- **Interactive Behavior**: Nodes can be draggable, resizable, rotatable, and selectable
- **Grouping**: Nodes can be organized into groups for better visual organization
- **Templates**: Custom visual representations for different node types - can be used any Angular component as a node template, enabling rich, dynamic content and interaction

### Ports

Ports are connection points on nodes where edges can start or end. They provide structured connection points and enable validation.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Connection Points**: Ports define where edges can connect on a node
- **Positioning**: Ports can be placed on any side of a node (left, right, top, bottom) in the center of the node's edge by default. They can also be precisely positioned using CSS properties (top, left, bottom, right)

### Edges

Edges connect nodes and represent relationships, data flow, or dependencies between elements.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Connection Points**: Edges connect from one node to another
- **Routing**: Edges can follow different paths (straight, curved, orthogonal)
- **Ports**: Edges can connect to specific connection points on nodes
- **Styling**: Custom visual appearance with colors, line styles, and arrows
- **Validation**: Connection rules can be enforced during edge creation

### Viewport

The viewport is the working space where all diagram interactions happen. It represents the visible area of the diagram and can be manipulated by the user.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Working Area**: The viewport is where all nodes, edges, and interactions take place
- **Zoom Control**: Users can zoom in to see details or zoom out for an overview
- **Panning**: The viewport can be moved around to navigate different areas of the diagram
- **Coordinate System**: All elements are positioned relative to the viewport's coordinate system
- **Responsive**: The viewport adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
