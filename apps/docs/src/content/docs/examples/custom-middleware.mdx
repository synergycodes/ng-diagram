import ReadonlyMiddleware from '@examples/readonly-middleware/readonly-middleware.astro';

This example demonstrates how to create a custom middleware that implements read-only functionality for ngDiagram. Middlewares provide a powerful plugin architecture for extending diagram behavior by intercepting state changes before they reach the model.

The read-only middleware demonstrates how to:

- **Block specific actions** based on configuration
- **Allow selective operations** through an allowlist
- **Cancel operations** to prevent state changes
- **Log warnings** for blocked actions

The middleware prevents users from modifying the diagram while still allowing actions like selection changes.
