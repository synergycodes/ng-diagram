import CodeViewer from '@components/code-viewer/code-viewer.astro';
import ReadonlyMiddleware from '@examples/readonly-middleware/readonly-middleware.astro';

This example demonstrates how to create a custom middleware that implements read-only functionality for ngDiagram.
Middlewares provide a powerful plugin architecture for extending diagram behavior by intercepting state changes before they reach the model.

<ReadonlyMiddleware />

### Key Concepts

- **Action Blocking:** Block specific actions based on configuration.
- **Allowlist:** Permit selective operations through an allowlist.
- **Operation Cancellation:** Cancel operations to prevent unwanted state changes.
- **Logging:** Log warnings for blocked actions.
