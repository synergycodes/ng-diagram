description: Example of how to integrate layout algorithms in ngDiagram
---

NgDiagram provides built-in layout functionality exposed through the `NgDiagramService` class. Currently only tree layout is supported.
For finer control over layouts you may integrate with external layout libraries to automatically position and arrange diagram elements.

The implementation below shows:

- How to use built-in layout using `NgDiagramService`
- How to use external layout libraries like ELK.js

## Implementation Example

import ExampleViewer from '@components/example-viewer/example-viewer.astro';
import LayoutIntegration from '@examples/layout-integration/layout-integration.astro';

<LayoutIntegration />
<ExampleViewer dirName="layout-integration" />
