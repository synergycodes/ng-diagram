This example demonstrates how to create custom ports in NgDiagram by customizing their appearance and behavior.

## Key Concepts

- **Custom Port Styling:**  
  Ports can be styled individually using CSS classes, inline styles, or by overriding CSS variables used in port styling.

- **Dynamic Port Rendering:**  
  Ports are rendered using the `<ng-diagram-port>` component, which supports various attributes.

- **Node Template Customization:**  
  The node template `NodeComponent` defines how ports are arranged and styled within each node.

- **Port Binding:**  
  Ports have a `type` property to set the connection type for each port. You can set it to `'both'`, `'target'`, or `'source'`.

- **Port Positioning:**  
  Ports have a `side` property to set their placement.  
  To further customize port placement, you can use CSS styling.

## Example Overview

Two nodes are rendered, each with four ports (left, top, right, bottom).

- The right port of the second node uses a custom CSS class taken from node data for a unique look and styling.
- The top port has a changed inline position in both nodes.
- The left port is customized with inline styles based on a property passed from node data.
- The bottom port has no changes.

## Example Code

### Node Template HTML

<CodeSnippet relativePath="examples/custom-ports/node/node.component.html" range={[1, 32]} mark={[{ range: '9-31' }]} />

### Custom Port CSS

<CodeSnippet
  relativePath="examples/custom-ports/node/node.component.scss"
  range={[1, 32]}
  mark={[{ range: '23-31' }]}
  collapse={['1-21']}
/>

## Usage

- Assign a custom CSS class to a node's port via node data.
- Style the port using CSS for unique shapes or hover effects.
- Override CSS variables used in `NgDiagramPortComponent`.
- Use inline styles for quick adjustments.
