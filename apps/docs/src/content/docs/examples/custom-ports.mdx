This example demonstrates how to create custom ports in ngDiagram by customizing their appearance and behavior.

<CodeViewer dirName="examples/custom-ports" />

## Additional Explanation

### Example Overview

Two nodes are rendered, each with four ports (left, top, right, bottom).

- The left port of the second node uses a data property to apply red background.
- The top port has a changed inline position in both nodes.
- The right port is customized with styles based on class property.

### Key Concepts

- **Custom Port Styling:**
  Ports can be styled individually using CSS classes, inline styles, or by overriding CSS variables used in port styling.

- **Dynamic Port Rendering:**
  Ports are rendered using the [`<ng-diagram-port>`](/docs/api/components/ngdiagramportcomponent) component, which supports various attributes.

- **Node Template Customization:**
  The `NodeComponent` template defines the arrangement and styling of ports within each node.

- **Port Binding:**
  Ports have a [`type`](/docs/api/types/model/port/#type) property to set the connection type for each port. You can set it to `'both'`, `'target'`, or `'source'`.

- **Port Positioning:**
  Ports have a [`side`](/docs/api/types/model/port/#side) property to set their placement.
  To further customize port placement, you can use CSS styling.
