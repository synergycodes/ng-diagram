This example demonstrates the performance capabilities of the Angular Flow library by rendering 500 nodes arranged in a 25x20 grid with almost 500 connections.

import PerformanceTest from '@examples/performance-test/performance-test.astro';
import ExampleViewer from '@components/example-viewer/example-viewer.astro';

<PerformanceTest />
<ExampleViewer dirName="stress-test" />
