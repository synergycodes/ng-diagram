## Context

Each scenario requires its own dedicated implementation.
To handle this, you can use **Custom Nodes**.

Defining a custom node is straightforward â€” it only requires:

1. Adding your component to the configuration by defining custom node types in `nodeTemplateMap` and passing them to the diagram.
2. Assigning `type` value for the node you want to customize. The type value must match the node type identifier in your diagram configuration.

Inside the custom node component, you can create **any Angular component template** you need and leverage the functionalities of the base node.
You can include anything inside the Custom Node, including controls from **external libraries**.

Once created, the custom node component will be rendered directly on the diagram, allowing you to build any type of graph from it.

import CustomNode from '@examples/custom-node/custom-node.astro';
import ExampleViewer from '@components/example-viewer/example-viewer.astro';

<CustomNode />

<ExampleViewer dirName="custom-node" />
