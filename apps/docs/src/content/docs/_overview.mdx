## What is ngDiagram?

ngDiagram is a powerful Angular diagramming library for building interactive diagram interfaces.
It features customizable nodes, edges, and ports, group containers, a palette system, service and middleware architecture, a command system, and full theming support.
ngDiagram provides a complete toolkit for creating, customizing, and managing diagrams with advanced features and high performance.

### What You Can Build

With ngDiagram, you can create:

- **Flow Diagrams**: Process flows, decision trees, and workflow visualizations
- **Node-Based Editors**: Visual programming interfaces and data flow editors
- **Network Diagrams**: System architectures and network topologies
- **Mind Maps**: Hierarchical information structures and brainstorming tools
- **Circuit Diagrams**: Electronic schematics and technical drawings
- **Custom Visualizations**: Any diagram type with custom node and edge templates

### Key Features

ngDiagram provides a comprehensive set of features for building interactive diagrams:

- **Interactive Elements**: Draggable, resizable, and rotatable nodes with smooth animations
- **Customizable Connections**: Flexible edges with various routing options (polyline, curved, orthogonal)
- **Ports**: Structured, stylable connection points on nodes, with validation and custom positioning
- **Groups**: Container nodes for organizing and managing multiple nodes, with auto/manual sizing, highlighting, and selection
- **Palette System**: Drag-and-drop palette for adding nodes to diagrams
- **Consistent Styling**: Built-in design system with CSS variables and themes for consistent styling and easy customization ([see Styling](../styling))
- **Service Layer**: Injectable Angular services for model, selection, viewport, groups, clipboard, and more
- **Command System**: Atomic operations with undo/redo support for robust editing workflows
- **Middleware & Plugins**: Extensible architecture for custom behaviors and business logic
- **Multiple Diagrams**: Scoped context for rendering and managing multiple diagrams on a single page
- **Reactive State Management**: Built on Angular signals for optimal performance and real-time updates
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with generic templates for compile-time error checking
- **Clipboard Support**: Copy, paste, and clipboard operations for diagram elements

## Understanding Diagram Elements

Before diving into the technical architecture, let's understand the fundamental elements that make up any diagram:

### Nodes

Nodes are the primary visual elements in your diagram. They represent entities, processes, or data points in your system.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Visual Representation**: Each node has a position, size, and visual appearance
- **Data Container**: Nodes can store custom data for your application logic
- **Interactive Behavior**: Nodes can be draggable, resizable, rotatable, and selectable
- **Grouping**: Nodes can be organized into groups for better visual organization
- **Templates**: Custom visual representations for different node types - Angular components are used as node templates, enabling rich, dynamic content and interaction

### Ports

Ports are connection points on nodes where edges can start or end. They provide structured connection points and enable validation.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Connection Points**: Ports define where edges can connect on a node
- **Positioning**: Ports can be placed on any side of a node (left, right, top, bottom), by default in the middle of the edge. They can also be precisely positioned using CSS properties like top, left, bottom, or right.

### Edges

Edges connect nodes and represent relationships, data flow, or dependencies between elements.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Connection Points**: Edges connect from one node to another
- **Routing**: Edges can follow different paths (polyline, curved, orthogonal)
- **Ports**: Edges can connect to specific connection points on nodes
- **Styling**: Custom visual appearance with colors, line styles, and arrows
- **Validation**: Connection rules can be enforced during edge creation

### Groups

Groups are container nodes that organize and manage multiple nodes as a single unit, enabling collective operations and visual organization.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Container Node**: Groups encapsulate other nodes while maintaining global coordinates for child nodes
- **Visual Organization**: Essential for representing subsystems, clusters, or logical groupings in complex diagrams
- **Collective Operations**: Move, select, and manage multiple nodes together as a single unit
- **Automatic Sizing**: Groups can automatically resize to fit their contents or be manually resized
- **Interactive Behavior**: Groups support highlighting when nodes are dragged over them and can be selected

### Viewport

The viewport is the working space where all diagram interactions happen. It represents the visible area of the diagram and can be manipulated by the user.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Working Area**: The viewport is where all nodes, edges, and interactions take place
- **Zoom Control**: Users can zoom in to see details or zoom out for an overview
- **Panning**: The viewport can be moved around to navigate different areas of the diagram
- **Coordinate System**: All elements are positioned relative to the viewport's coordinate system
- **Responsive**: The viewport adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
