/**
 * Defines custom event types used throughout the ngDiagram library for handling user input.
 *
 * The main type, `PointerInputEvent`, extends the native `PointerEvent` with additional flags
 * that indicate whether specific diagram interactions (such as selection, zooming, linking, rotation)
 * have already been handled. These flags are used by input event directives and handlers
 * to coordinate and prevent duplicate processing of the same pointer event.
 *
 * This type is used as the event parameter in input event handlers and services
 * across the public API and internal logic.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```ts
 * onPointerDown(event: PointerInputEvent) {
 *   if (!event.linkingHandled) {
 *     // handle linking logic
 *     event.linkingHandled = true;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
